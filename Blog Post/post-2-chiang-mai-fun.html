            <h1>Tour-Town</h1>
            <h2>First off, Chiang Mai is very cheap and very touristy. When you see a person on the street, chances are their job is to cater to tourists, or they are a tourist. Sort of unsettling, but it also means that you can meet a bunch of people traveling from all over the world, and it's easy to do things like adventure or eat. Also, even when the people here are trying to scam you or get your money, they do it in the nicest way - when you say no, they cheerily accept that. People never seem to be angry or annoying when you <i>don't</i> buy their goods, which is really nice! It's always depressing when somebody's kind... until it becomes clear that you aren't going to give them money. </h2>

            <h1>VIP House; Julie's</h1>
            <h2>We spent the first few days exploring Chiang Mai by foot - food, massage parlours, food, and more massage parlours. The pad thai here is about $1 at cheap places. Although, to be fair, we haven't yet tasted pad thai that is better than our own, and we eat pad thai about every day. We stayed three nights in a nice hostel called VIP House, at 350 baht a night, air conditioned ($10). Next, we tried Julie's, which is (justifiably) ranked highly online. The didn't have air conidioned rooms, which made sleeping hard, but there was an awesome, colorful common room where all the travelers hung out.</h2>

The big roads are scary and you have to be carful: they do not give you helmets and everyone is driving haphazardly and on the opposite side of the road. Once you get out of the epicenter of the city, however, it's okay.</h2>

            <h1>3 Day Stay</h1>
            <h2>A huge component of the tourism industry here are 'treks'. There are hilariously worded (seriously, has no one heard of google translate?) posters for adventures - elephant riding, rafting, visiting hill-tribes, zip-lining, and hiking - posted all around the city. Many hostels, including Julie's, will not let you stay more than a few days unless you book a trek through them, because they generally earn a few hundred baht from the mark-up. We really liked Julie's, and I really wanted to go on a trek, so we decided to take the plunge. </h2>

            <h2>However, we didn't want to stay with hill-tribe people (something about paying people so you can blatantly stare at their 'culture' and does not sit well with me), and we did not want to ride elephants (training elephants consists of chaining them up and poking them with sticks for days until their spirits break, and riding elephants is also terrible for their backs). So we opted to go on a four hour hike that included swimming in a waterfall. We wanted to do this on our own, but figuring out how to get to a good area with no car and no good online directions was too difficult. $1200 baht ($40) per person was a lot, but it turned out to be totally worth it.

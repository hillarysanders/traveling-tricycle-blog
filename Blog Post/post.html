            <h1>The Flights</h1>
            <h2>After Jacob's dad dropped us off at the Seattle airport, we waited for a few hours near our terminal, got lost, and just figured out how to train to our gate as our plane was boarding. We took flight at 2:00 AM, and twelve hours (and two multiple course meals served to us by pretty flight attendants in aprons) later, we arrived in Taipei. Luckily, the Taipei airport rapidly made me forget the taste of the lungs that were served to us on the airplane (sort of like badly pickled cabbage).  The waiting rooms were pretty cool. One was Hello Kitty themed, complete with Hello Kitty phone booths. Ours was flight-history themed: blue everywhere with hot air balloons to sit in. One more three hour flight and we arrived in Bangkok, Thailand. </h2>

            <h1>Arrival to Bangkok</h1>
            <h2>Customs was a breeze, although we were prepared for the worst. We realized that we really should have brought cash (BofA charges a $10 fee plus a bad conversion rate every time you withdraw money), but what can ya do. So, we set out on our journey. It was hot. With our packs on our backs, we walked four or five hours through the city of Bangkok. Did I mention it was hot? I'm not sure if I've ever sweat that much in my life. Bankok is sprawling. There seems to be no epicenter. Just high towers, tiny shanty buildings, and then more high towers, and more tiny shanty buildings.  </h2>

A clean bed in an air conditioned room after five hours of walking through the steaming city of bangkok is... quite orgasmic. Sorry parents. </h2>

            <h1>Bangkok to Chiang Mai</h1>
            <h2>We spent three days wandering around Bangkok, eating cheap food and finding nice areas. Showers after walking for a few hours in the heat are amazing. On the fourth day, we took the 15 hour train to Chiang Mai, a city in northern Thailand (Bangkok is in the south). It was quite touristy, but not in a bad way, and very cheap. We stayed in the 'old-city', a mile-by-mile square that is the epicenter of the city. There's about two massage parlours a block ($4-8 for an hour long massage. Yeah.), and a Seven-11 every few blocks (glorious air conditioned escapes with delicious melon milk and packaged pork burgers).
